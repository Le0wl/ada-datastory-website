# Our Choice of Events

Our goal is not only to study the spread of news, but to also examine how it is affected by the location of the event in question as well as its type. For this purpose, we consider three general regions to compare: the US, Europe, and Asia. As for the event type, we originally went for four classes: geopolotical conflicts (focusing on armed clashes), enviornmental disasters, economical crisis and political (mainly elections), with the goal of having two events per categories per location. However we later decided to reduce the number of event types and increase the number of videos per type to have a more accuracte and complete representation.

***Geopolitical conflicts/ armed conflicts***

**US:**

- **Mosul Offensive (2016-2017) - Iraq:** A major urban battle where Iraqi security forces, backed by US-led coalition airpower and international special forces, launched a nine-month campaign to liberate Mosul from ISIS control. The conflict saw intense street-by-street fighting and significant civilian casualties, ending with the city’s recapture but leaving much of it in ruins.
- **Battle of Kobani (2014-2015) - Syria:** A key turning point in the war against ISIS, where Kurdish YPG forces, supported by US-led coalition airstrikes, defended the besieged city of Kobani near the Turkish border. The fierce, months-long battle significantly weakened ISIS and showcased the effectiveness of Kurdish and US-coalition collaboration.
- **Battle of Raqqa (June - October 2017) - Syria:** The climactic urban combat operation where the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) recaptured Raqqa, ISIS's self-declared capital. Supported by extensive US airstrikes, the battle resulted in heavy casualties and large-scale destruction, symbolizing the collapse of ISIS's territorial control.
- **Kunduz City Attack (2015) - Afghanistan:** Taliban forces launched a surprise assault on Kunduz, seizing the city for several days before being driven out by Afghan forces with US air support. The campaign drew international condemnation after a US airstrike mistakenly hit a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital, causing significant civilian casualties.
- **Battle of Sirte (2016) - Libya:** Libyan government-aligned forces, with support from US airstrikes, fought for control of Sirte, ISIS’s North African stronghold. After months of intense street fighting, Libyan forces reclaimed the city, dealing a major blow to ISIS’s presence in the region.

**Asia:**

- **India-Pakistan Conflict / Kashmir Conflict (Pulwama and Balakot Airstrikes) (February 2019):** A suicide bombing by a Pakistan-based militant group in Pulwama killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel, prompting retaliatory Indian airstrikes in Balakot. The incident triggered cross-border clashes, escalating tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
- **Syrian Civil War (Aleppo Offensive (2016)):** In Aleppo, Syrian government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, launched a brutal offensive against rebels, reclaiming the city after months of relentless bombardment.
- **Yemeni Civil War, battle of Hudayah (June - December 2018 ) -** The **Battle of Hudaydah (June - December 2018)** was the largest and most critical clash in the **Yemeni Civil War**. It involved a massive offensive by the **Saudi-led coalition** and Yemeni government forces against **Houthi rebels** to seize control of **Hudaydah Port**, Yemen's primary entry point for humanitarian aid and supplies. The battle saw **intense urban warfare**, **heavy airstrikes**, and **naval blockades**, resulting in thousands of casualties on both sides and severe civilian suffering. Fears of a **humanitarian disaster** due to potential disruptions in food and medical imports drew international condemnation. The fighting ultimately led to a **UN-brokered ceasefire** under the **Stockholm Agreement** in December 2018, halting the offensive and averting mass starvation in Yemen.

**Europe:**

- **Crimea Annexation and Conflict in Eastern Ukraine (2014):** Russia’s military annexation of Crimea and subsequent backing of separatist rebels in Ukraine’s Donbas region triggered an armed conflict with Ukrainian forces. The crisis led to thousands of deaths, economic sanctions against Russia, and a prolonged geopolitical standoff.
- **Nagorno-Karabakh Conflicts (Clashes (2016)) - Armenia-Azerbaijan:** A brief but intense escalation of hostilities over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, featuring artillery duels, tank battles, and significant casualties on both sides. Despite a ceasefire, tensions between the two countries remain unresolved.

The choice of events was rigorous, as we only wanted events that had a clear starting date that accurately represents the response to breaking news and that we can use for filtration. We also looked for the most popular and impactful events for each category, i.e. the ones that garnered the most reporting, to maximize the datapoints and best represent the event types.
