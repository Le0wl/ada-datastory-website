## Introduction
Journalism is often seen as the 4ht pillar of democracy. It serves as a watchdog for the government, and informs the public about events happening around the world. 100 years ago journalism took mainly place in newspapers, it has mostly moved to the digital world by now. While this shift has made news accesible for a wider public, it also gave rise to fake news and disinformation. In this datastory we want to study youtube as a news source with the data provided by the [Youniverse](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/YouNiverse) Dataset. More specifically we want to have a look at the reporting of US news channels during geopolitical events and natural disasters. 

But why youtube? Youtube is the largest video-sharing platform and the [second most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites) often visited website in the world. Everyday over **5 billion** hours of video content is [uploaded](https://www.madpenguin.org/how-many-youtube-videos-are-uploaded-every-day/). But is it relevant to news? Yes! `News & Politics` is the biggest category on youtube, meaning that most of the videos on youtube are about news or politics. These videos are watched by millions of people everyday. As of 2020, [26%](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2020/09/28/many-americans-get-news-on-youtube-where-news-organizations-and-independent-producers-thrive-side-by-side/) of US adults indicated that they get their news from youtube. So as you can see it is interesting to study youtube as a news source.
